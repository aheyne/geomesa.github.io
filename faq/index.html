        <h2>What is the best way to ingest data into GeoMesa?</h2>
        <p>The GeoMesa command line tools provide an easy way to ingest data in
           variety of formats. Tools distributions are provided for all major
           back-end implemenations. See the user guide for information on setting
           up the command line tools:

        <a name="queries-hang"></a>
        <h2>Why do my queries hang (never finish)?</h2>
        <p>Although it is possible to request such a large number of records
        that queries timeout or appear never to finish, the far more frequent cause of this
        behavior is a mis-configured cloud.  Check to be sure that ports are open on
        all nodes; that clock-time is reasonably consistent among the nodes; and
        that all software versions are the same across your cluster.</p>

        <a name="tables-naming-convention"></a>
        <h2>Why are there multiple tables for my one feature?</h2>
        <p>GeoMesa supports secondary indexes, and we do this by using
        multiple support tables per feature (or group of features). See
        <a href="http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/user/datastores/index_overview.html">Index Overview</a>
        for a discussion of the various indices used by GeoMesa.</p>

        <h2>Why is my CRS not being read?</h2>
        <p>If the GeoTools packages for reading EPSG data are on your classpath,
        review the permissions on your temporary directory. If multiple users share
        an environment, the temporary directory containing EPSG data
        can be owned by a different user.</p>
        <p>Another option is to ensure that you are using your own, specific
        directory.  To do that, include <code>-Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp/YourUsername</code>
        (substituting your username) when running a JVM.</p>

        <h2>What do I need to do to include GeoMesa in a shaded JAR?</h2>
        <p>If you rebundle GeoMesa as part of a larger project's JAR file,
        it is important to ensure that the manifest includes the proper
        entries for the service-provider interfaces (SPIs); otherwise, the
        various factories will be unable to find the implementations you
        expect.</p>
