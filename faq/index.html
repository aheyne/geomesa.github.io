        Frequently Asked Questions

        <a name="how-many-tables"></a>
        <h2>Does each data type need its own table?</h2>
        <p>No.  So long as the index-schema formats are distinct &#151; and by
        default this will always be the case for any two <code>FeatureType</code>s
        that have different feature names &#151; then any number of features
        can share the same table.  It is possible, by using custom index-schema
        formats, to introduce confusion between feature types within the same
        table; this is one reason why using those advanced features is not
        recommended for developers who are new to GeoMesa.</p>

        <a name="node-time-sync"></a>
        <h2>Why do GeoMesa queries never return?</h2>
        <p>Though it is possible to construct queries that take a long time to
        finish &#151; an attribute query that has no geo-spatial or temporal
        constraint &#151; most will return reasonably quickly.  We have seen an
        instance where a query on a small data set did not return at all, but
        that turned out to be a problem with the cluster's configuration rather
        than being an issue with GeoMesa.  (The specific issue had to do with
        time not being adequately synchronized across the nodes in the cluster.)</p>

        <a name="accumulo-versions"></a>
        <h2>What versions of Accumulo are compatible with GeoMesa?</h2>
        <p>The tip of the <code>master</code> code branch supports Accumulo 1.5;
        the team is working on concurrent support for multiple versions of
        Accumulo now.</p>

        <a name="epsg-acls"></a>
        <h2>Why is my CRS not being read?</h2>
        <p>If the GeoTools packages for reading EPSG data are on your classpath,
        review the permissions on your temporary directory.  On multiple occasions,
        we have seen issues when the temporary directory containing EPSG data
        has been owned by a different user.</p>

        <a name="geotools-spi"></a>
        <h2>What do I need to do to rebundle GeoMesa?</h2>
        <p>If you rebundle GeoMesa as part of a larger project's JAR file,
        it is important to ensure that the manifest includes the proper
        entries for the service-provider interfaces (SPIs); otherwise, the
        various factories will be unable to find the implementations you
        expect.</p>
