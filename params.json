Some of these tools such as\r\nthe GeneralShapefileIngest have Map/Reduce components, so the geomesa-utils JAR lives on HDFS.\r\n\r\n### geomesa-dist\r\n\r\nThis sub-project contains the distribution-ready TAR-ball as well as the\r\ndocumentation (in DocBook form, rendered to PDF).\r\n\r\n##  Checkout out and build GeoMesa\r\n\r\n* Navigate to where you would like to download this project.\r\n* git clone git@github.com:geomesa/geomesa.git\r\n\r\n## Building Instructions\r\n\r\nThis project is managed by Maven, and builds with the command\r\n\r\n```mvn clean install```\r\n\r\nFrom the root directory, this builds each sub-project with its additional dependencies-included JAR.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAnthony Fox (@anthonyfoxccri), Skylar Lyon (@shl7c), and Chris Eichelberger (@cne1x) maintain GeoMesa.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact us at the geomesa-user and geomesa-dev google groups.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
